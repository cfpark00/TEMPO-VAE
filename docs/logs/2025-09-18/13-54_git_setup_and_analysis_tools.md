# Development Log: Git Setup and Analysis Tools
**Date:** 2025-09-18
**Time:** 13:54
**Developer:** Claude (with cfpark00)

## Summary
Set up git repository, implemented VAE reconstruction analysis, and created PCA component extraction tools for TEMPO spectral data visualization.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Git Repository Setup
- Initialized git repository for the TEMPO project
- Reviewed and validated `.gitignore` configuration
- Created initial commit with all project files
- Set up remote repository link to `git@github.com:cfpark00/TEMPO-VAE.git`
- Note: Included `data/jan_2025_files.txt` despite being in ignored directory (per user request)

### 2. Old Code Review
- Analyzed `old/` directory contents to understand missing functionality
- Identified key research capabilities from old code:
  - Direct TEMPO L1 radiance processing
  - Wandb integration for experiment tracking
  - Spectral error analysis and visualization
  - Interactive Jupyter notebooks for analysis
- Determined current codebase focuses on production pipeline while old code was research/analysis oriented

### 3. VAE Reconstruction Analysis Tool
- **Config:** `configs/analysis/reconstruction_analysis.yaml`
- **Script:** `src/scripts/analyze_reconstruction.py`
- Key features implemented:
  - Loads trained VAE checkpoint and processes validation data
  - Applies exact same normalization as training (log transform, z-score, clip)
  - Supports full image reconstruction (not just 64x64 tiles)
  - Two visualization modes:
    - Single channel visualization with matched color scales
    - PCA RGB visualization (3 components as RGB channels)

### 4. PCA Component Extraction
- **Config:** `configs/analysis/extract_pca_components.yaml`
- **Script:** `src/scripts/extract_pca_components.py`
- **Bash wrapper:** `scripts/analysis/extract_pca_components.sh`
- Extracts principal components from TEMPO spectral data for RGB visualization
- Samples 256 pixels per file across configurable number of files
- Saves PCA model, components, and projections for reuse

## Technical Details

### VAE Architecture Insights
- Input shape: `[1028, 64, 64]` (spectral channels, spatial)
- Encoder downsampling: 3 layers but only 2 actually downsample (last has `no_down=True`)
- Latent shape: `[32, 16, 16]` (32 channels, 16x16 spatial)
- Compression ratio: **514x** (4,210,688 → 8,192 values)
- TEMPO has 1028 spectral channels (not 1024)

### Normalization Pipeline
Consistent across all tools:
1. Log transform with `min_radiance=1.0` clamp
2. Z-score normalization with global mean/std
3. Clip to `[-10, 10]` range

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed all scripts to use `init_directory()` utility for proper overwrite handling
- Ensured all scripts follow repo conventions (config validation, fail-fast philosophy)
- Added proper device handling for GPU/CPU tensors
- Implemented consistent error handling and config copying

## Issues Fixed
- Corrected tensor dimension ordering for NC file → VAE processing
- Fixed device mismatch errors between CUDA and CPU tensors
- Properly implemented `--overwrite` flag behavior per repo standards
- Fixed PCA RGB visualization with proper percentile-based scaling

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `configs/analysis/reconstruction_analysis.yaml`
- `configs/analysis/extract_pca_components.yaml`
- `src/scripts/analyze_reconstruction.py`
- `src/scripts/extract_pca_components.py`
- `scripts/analysis/extract_pca_components.sh`

### Modified Files
- Various fixes to ensure consistent use of `init_directory()`

## Next Steps
- Could add wandb integration from old code if needed
- Consider adding more visualization modes (spectral plots, error maps)
- Potentially integrate compression quality metrics from old notebooks

## Notes
- User prefers direct, concise communication
- Strong emphasis on code correctness and following established patterns
- Repository follows strict fail-fast philosophy for research integrity
