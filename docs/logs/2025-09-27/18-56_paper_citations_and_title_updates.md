# Paper Citations and Title Updates - September 27, 2025 (18:56)

## Overview
Major updates to the AAAI 2026 paper focusing on citations, title changes, and compilation fixes.

## Key Tasks Completed

### 1. Title Updates
- **Changed paper title** from "Learning Atmospheric Composition from Hyperspectral Satellite Data Using Variational Autoencoders" to **"Neural Compression and Component Extraction of Hyperspectral Data"**
- More concise and general title that better reflects the technical approach
- Emphasizes both compression and component extraction aspects

### 2. Citation Additions and Fixes
- **Added TEMPO citation**: `\citep{zoogman2017tropospheric}` when first introduced
- **Added VAE citations**: `\citep{kingma2013auto}` (original VAE paper) and `\citep{higgins2016beta}` (β-VAE for disentanglement)
- **Added GroupNorm citation**: `\citep{wu2018group}` in VAE architecture section
- **Added AdamW citation**: `\citep{loshchilov2019decoupled}` moved from table to caption
- **Added PyTorch citation**: `\citep{paszke2019pytorch}` moved from bullet point to section text
- **Added hyperspectral citations**: `\citep{paoletti2019deep,manifold2021versatile}` for classification work
- **Added neural compression citation**: `\citep{yang2024lossyimagecompressionconditional}` in image compression section
- **Added CNN foundation citations**: `\citep{fukushima1980neocognitron,krizhevsky2012imagenet}` for Neocognitron and AlexNet

### 3. Paper Structure Improvements
- **Updated Data section**: Changed "Data Preprocessing" to "Data Preparation" with better introduction to TEMPO mission
- **Added full-width figure**: Made TEMPO 5-panel data figure use `\textwidth` instead of `\columnwidth` for better visibility
- **Moved citations out of tables**: Relocated AdamW and PyTorch citations from table cells to captions/section text
- **Added CNN mention**: Noted that VAE architecture is built on CNNs in appendix

### 4. Data Visualization Script Updates
- **Fixed L1 visualization**: Updated `simple_5panel_plot.py` to use same RGB approach as VAE training (channels 100, 500, 900 with percentile normalization)
- **Fixed file selection**: Made file and region selection properly random with seed 123
- **Added proper normalization**: Applied pre-computed L2 statistics for asinh/zscore/logit normalization
- **Removed fallbacks**: Script now crashes on missing files instead of silent failures
- **Updated to 5 panels**: Removed NO2 stratosphere, kept only troposphere

### 5. Compilation and Bibliography Management
- **Fixed citation formatting**: Resolved "???" display issues in compiled PDF
- **Updated bibliography**: Added new entries for Paoletti, Manifold hyperspectral papers
- **Multiple compilation cycles**: Ran pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex sequence to resolve all citations
- **Final paper stats**: 7 pages, 14 references, all citations properly resolved

## Technical Details

### Paper Compilation
- Used proper LaTeX compilation sequence: pdflatex → bibtex → pdflatex
- Resolved all undefined citation warnings
- Final PDF: 961,469 bytes, 7 pages

### Citation Management
- Moved from inline table citations to caption/section citations for better formatting
- Used `\citet{}` vs `\citep{}` appropriately for textual vs parenthetical citations
- Ensured all bibliography entries processed correctly

### Figure Management
- Updated TEMPO 5-panel figure to full text width for better readability
- Copied updated figure from `scratch/` to `paper/figures/`
- Added detailed caption explaining each panel's normalization approach

## Files Modified
- `paper/main.tex` - Main paper document with all updates
- `paper/aaai2026.bib` - Bibliography with new entries
- `scratch/simple_5panel_plot.py` - Visualization script with proper L1 rendering
- `paper/figures/tempo_5panel.png` - Updated data visualization figure

## Remaining Issues
- Some font encoding warnings in LaTeX (missing characters) - cosmetic only
- Paper ready for submission with all requested changes implemented

## Final Status
✅ Paper title updated to "Neural Compression and Component Extraction of Hyperspectral Data"
✅ All major citations added (TEMPO, VAE, CNN foundations, hyperspectral work)
✅ Data visualization fixed with proper L1 RGB rendering
✅ Citations moved out of tables to appropriate locations
✅ Full compilation successful with all references resolved
✅ Final paper: 7 pages, 14 references, ready for review
