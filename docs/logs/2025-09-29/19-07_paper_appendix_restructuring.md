# Paper Appendix Restructuring and Data Normalization Documentation
**Date:** 2025-09-29 19:07
**Session Duration:** ~3 hours
**Focus:** AAAI 2026 paper appendix organization and detailed normalization documentation

## Summary
Completed major reorganization of the paper appendix, added comprehensive data normalization documentation, and restructured the Results section. Fixed LaTeX figure placement issues and verified all technical details against actual implementation code.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Results Section Restructuring
- Reorganized Results section into three main subsections:
  - **Compression and Reconstruction Performance**: Combined compression metrics with reconstruction quality analysis
  - **Unsupervised Component Extraction**: Consolidated probe results (linear + MLP) from unsupervised VAE
  - **Latent Supervised Component Extraction**: Empty subsection prepared for future supervised VAE results
- Moved reconstruction figure and discussion into first subsection for better flow

### 2. Appendix Complete Reorganization
**Original structure:** Single "Experimental Details" section with 9 subsections
**New structure:** 5 well-organized sections with proper labels

#### Section A: Data
- Added comprehensive 3-paragraph TEMPO mission overview:
  - Mission description (launch, orbit, global constellation)
  - Instrument specifications (spectrometer, detectors, spatial resolution)
  - Dataset description (what we use: 70 granules, LA region, Jan 2025)
- **Subsection A.1: Normalization Strategy**
  - **L1B Radiance Normalization**: Detailed 3-stage pipeline
    - Log transformation: `log(max(radiance, 1.0))`
    - Channel-wise z-score using global statistics from 10 files (2.4M pixels)
    - Clipping to [-10, 10]
    - Table 1: Global statistics (mean: 4.80-30.68, std: 1.13-12.18 in log-space)
  - **L2 Product Normalization**: Product-specific transformations
    - NO₂ & HCHO: asinh with MAD-based scaling (handles negatives & heavy tails)
    - Total Ozone: Standard z-score (approximately Gaussian)
    - Cloud Fraction: Logit with boundary squeeze (ε=0.01)
    - Verified scaling factors: NO₂ ÷ 10^15, HCHO ÷ 10^16, O₃ ÷ 1.0, Cloud ÷ 1.0
    - Table 2: L2 product specifications with units, scales, and normalization types
  - Included normalization comparison figure (Figure 3)

#### Section B: Model Specification
- **Subsection B.1: Architecture Details**: VAE architecture with 27.3M parameters
- **Subsection B.2: Training Configuration**: Table 3 with complete hyperparameters

#### Section C: Probing Methodology
- Table 4: Training configurations for linear and MLP probes

#### Section D: Code and Data Availability
- Repository contents description
- Data access information

#### Section E: Computational Requirements
- Consolidated from 5 subsections into single paragraph
- NVIDIA A100-SXM4-40GB (official name)
- 41 hours VAE training (200k steps, batch 32, input shape [32, 1028, 64, 64])
- Peak GPU memory ~25GB
- Probe training <5 minutes per component
- Storage: 220GB total (verified with `du -sh`)
  - 102GB raw L1B files
  - 51GB processed tiles
  - 51GB tiles with L2
  - 15GB individual L2 products
  - Model checkpoints (~1GB each)

### 3. LaTeX Figure Placement Issues Fixed
- **Problem**: Figure 1 (TEMPO 5-panel) appearing on page 3 despite `[ht!]` placement
- **Root cause**: `figure*` (two-column figures) can only be placed at top of pages in AAAI format
- **Solution**: Moved figure definition from after Related Work to beginning of Introduction
- Result: Figure now appears on page 2 at top, before Related Work section

### 4. Figure 1 Caption Enhancement
- Updated caption to be more descriptive
- Added panel labels (a-e) and detailed descriptions
- Included normalization method for each L2 product
- Added cross-references to appendix sections (App. A and A.1)

### 5. Technical Verification
- Read actual implementation code to verify all statements:
  - `/n/home12/cfpark00/TEMPO/src/scripts/compute_tempo_stats.py`
  - `/n/home12/cfpark00/TEMPO/src/scripts/prepare_tempo_tiles_with_l2.py`
  - `/n/home12/cfpark00/TEMPO/configs/data_preparation/prepare_tiles_with_l2.yaml`
  - `/n/home12/cfpark00/TEMPO/data/tempo_stats/manifest.yaml`
- Verified Table 1 values are real (not placeholders): from manifest.yaml
- Corrected L2 scaling description (division, not multiplication)
- Verified all L2 normalization formulas match code implementation
- Confirmed all table entries match config files exactly

### 6. Formatting Improvements
- Added "APPENDIX" centered heading before Section A
- Changed section title from "Data Processing" to just "Data"
- All sections and subsections properly labeled for cross-referencing
- Improved table captions with more context
- Added 1em spacing around APPENDIX heading

## Files Modified
- `paper/main.tex`: Major restructuring and additions (~200 lines changed)
- Sections affected:
  - Results section (lines 299-321)
  - Appendix sections (lines 342-520)
  - Figure 1 caption (line 186)

## Key Technical Details Documented

### L1B Normalization Pipeline
1. Log transform: `log(max(r, 1.0))`
2. Z-score per channel: `z = (log(r) - μ_λ) / (σ_λ + 1e-8)`
3. Clip: `[-10, 10]`
4. Statistics computed from 2,414,592 pixels (10 files)

### L2 Normalization Methods
- **NO₂/HCHO**: `asinh(x / s)` where `s = 1.4826 × MAD`
- **O₃**: `(x - μ) / σ`
- **Cloud**: `logit(0.01 + 0.98·x)`

### Storage Breakdown (verified via du -sh)
- Total: 220GB
- Raw L1B: 102GB (70 files)
- Tiles: 51GB
- Tiles+L2: 51GB
- L2 products: NO₂(4.5GB), O₃(4.9GB), HCHO(4.1GB), Cloud(1.5GB)

## LaTeX Compilation
- Successfully compiled: 8 pages, 1,013,310 bytes
- Minor warnings: undefined reference `tab:probes` (needs fixing in Results section)
- All figures rendered correctly

## Notes for Future Work
1. Need to add actual results table for probe R² scores (currently referenced but not present)
2. "Latent Supervised Component Extraction" subsection ready for supervised VAE results
3. Consider adding data flow diagram to Data section
4. May need to add probe architecture figure

## Context
This session focused on making the appendix more comprehensive and professional for AAAI 2026 submission. The detailed normalization documentation is critical for reproducibility and demonstrates rigorous attention to data preprocessing details.
