# LaTeX Multiplication Signs Fix

**Date**: 2025-09-29 21:39
**Session**: Fixing missing multiplication signs in paper

## Summary

Fixed all instances of missing or incorrectly rendered multiplication signs throughout the LaTeX paper. The issue was caused by bare Unicode × characters (U+00D7) not rendering properly in the Times font used by the AAAI 2026 conference style. All instances were converted to proper LaTeX `$\times$` in math mode.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Compression Ratio Notation (×514)
Changed all compression ratio instances from `514×` or `514$\times$` to `$\times$514` (multiplication sign BEFORE the number):

- **Line 203**: Introduction paragraph
- **Line 215**: First bullet point in contributions
- **Line 232**: Figure 2 caption
- **Line 264**: VAE Architecture section
- **Line 315**: Results section
- **Line 364**: Conclusion section

### 2. Fixed Tensor Dimensions
Changed tensor dimension notation from comma-separated to multiplication:

- **Line 204**: `[1028, 64, 64]` → `[1028 \times 64 \times 64]`
- **Line 204**: `[32, 16, 16]` → `[32 \times 16 \times 16]`

### 3. Fixed Spatial Dimensions
Converted all bare × characters to `$\times$` in math mode:

- **Line 188**: Figure 1 caption: `131×131` → `$131 \times 131$`
- **Line 259**: `64×64 pixel tiles` → `$64\times64$ pixel tiles`
- **Line 290**: `16×16 spatial resolution` → `$16\times16$ spatial resolution`
- **Line 305**: `4×4 spatial pooling, reducing the 64×64 input tiles to 16×16` → `$4\times4$ spatial pooling, reducing the $64\times64$ input tiles to $16\times16$`
- **Line 390**: Appendix detector specs: `2048 spatial pixels × 1028 spectral channels` → `2048 spatial pixels $\times$ 1028 spectral channels`
- **Line 390**: Appendix spatial resolution: `2 km North-South × 4.75 km East-West` → `2 km North-South $\times$ 4.75 km East-West`

## Technical Issue

The root cause was that the bare Unicode multiplication sign (×) character does not exist in the Times font (ptmr7t) used by the conference template. The LaTeX log showed repeated warnings:

```
Missing character: There is no � in font ptmr7t!
```

This caused the × characters to simply not render in the PDF, resulting in concatenated numbers like "6464" instead of "64×64".

## Solution

All multiplication signs must be wrapped in LaTeX math mode using `$\times$` to ensure proper rendering across all fonts.

## Files Modified

- `/n/holylfs06/LABS/finkbeiner_lab/Users/cfpark00/datadir/TEMPO/paper/main.tex`

## Compilation

Successfully recompiled the paper with full LaTeX → BibTeX → LaTeX → LaTeX cycle. All multiplication signs now render correctly in the PDF.

## Convention Established

- **Compression ratios**: `$\times$514` (multiplication sign BEFORE number)
- **Dimensions**: `$64\times64$` (multiplication sign BETWEEN numbers)
- **Tensor shapes**: `[1028 \times 64 \times 64]` (with spaces for readability)
